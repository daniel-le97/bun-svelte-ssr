# Caveats and Todos
- using Bun's bundler has been my first time dealing with transpilers/bundlers/caching, if theres alot that i am missing please let me know!
- the dev command has makeshift hmr functionality by only rebuilding the files that have changes, still needs work to exclude some files from registering changes
- mdsvex or .svx extensions mostly work, but we will need to add it as a real svelte preprocess step instead of a compiling step
